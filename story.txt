"Give me an adventure."
In the moment that followed, Cord realized that this sounded weird, 
and lost her nerve. She held up her hands. "I'm not talking about 
some massive adventure. Just something that would make getting 
fired seem small. Something that I might remember when I'm old."

Now for the first time I reviewed everything that had happened in the last twelve hours. It made me a little dizzy.

"Raz?" she said, after a while.
"I can't predict the future," I said, "but based on what little I know 
so far, I'm afraid it has to be a massive adventure or nothing."
"Great!"
"Probably the kind of adventure that ends in a mass burial."
That quieted her down a little bit. But after a while, she said: 
"Do you need transportation? Tools? Stuff?"
"Our opponent is an alien starship packed with atomic bombs," I said. 
"We have a protractor."
"Okay, I'll go home and see if I can scrounge up a 
ruler and a piece of string."
"That'd be great."
